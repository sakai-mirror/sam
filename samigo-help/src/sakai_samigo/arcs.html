<h2>Restricting access to published
assessments</h2>





<p>You cannot modify the access settings of a published assessment,
but you can remove a published assessment, modify the access settings
in the Pending assessment, and publish it again. To remove a published
assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcx">Deleting an assessment</a>. To change the
access settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the following settings:</p>

<ul><li>Under "Assessment Introduction": Title, Creator, Author(s), Description/Intro, and Attachments</li><li>Under "Delivery Dates": Available Date, Due Date, and Retract Date</li><li>Under "Assessment Organization": Navigation and Numbering</li><li>Under "Submissions": Number of Submissions Allowed and Late Handling</li><li>Under "Feedback": Feedback Authoring, Feedback Delivery, and Feedback Components Students Can See</li><li>Under "Grading": Students' Identities and Gradebook Options</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>
