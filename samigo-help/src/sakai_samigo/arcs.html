<h2>Restricting access to published
assessments</h2>








<p>You cannot modify the access settings of a published assessment,
but there is a possible workaround.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Core Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the "Delivery Dates" and
"Gradebook Options" settings.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Core Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>The possible workaround involves retracting the published
assessment, modifying the access settings to the "Core Assessments"
copy, and then publishing that version with a different name. Follow
these steps:</p>


<ol><li>Retract the published assessment; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting a published assessment</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>From the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> beneath the title of the assessment.

<br />
<br />
</li><li>From the list under "Assessment Released To", choose to release
the assessment to site members or to anonymous users.

<br />
<br />
</li><li>Under "High Security", you can use one or both of the following
options:

<br />
<br />

<ul><li>To restrict access to only certain computers on the
Internet, select <strong><code>Allow only specified IP
Addresses</code></strong>, and enter the IP addresses of those
computers.
</li><li>To require a secondary username and password, select <strong><code>Secondary
ID and Password</code></strong>, and then fill in the "Username" and "Password"
fields.
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Change the assessment's name. A slight change to the name of the
original (i.e., retracted) assessment will do, especially if you've
already shared the assessment's name with participants.<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Publish Assessment Confirmation page, you'll see the
settings you configured for the assessment, plus a URL you can use to
distribute the assessment. Click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong> again to confirm, or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.
</li></ol>
