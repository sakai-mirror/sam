<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To reach the Settings page for an assessment, from the menubar of
the appropriate worksite, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  On the Assessments page, click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> beneath the title of the assessment.  Click the
black arrow for a type of setting to see the options.
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Altering the settings for one assessment
does not impact the settings of other assessments you
created. Altering the options in the settings for an assessment does
not impact any other options.</p>


<p>The settings available depend on whether or not your assessment is
published.  They also depend on what template you have created for use
with an assessment. The default template does not include all possible
settings. Once an assessment is published, you may only edit the three
Delivery Dates settings, and the Gradebook Options (under "Grading")
setting.</p>

<p>If you wish to include more settings than you see available for an
unpublished assessment, you will need to create and edit a new
template. To do this, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding/creating, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.</p>
