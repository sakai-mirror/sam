<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>


<p>In order to give an assessment, you must first publish it. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardc">Publishing an assessment</a>. Once it's
published, your assessment's availability depends on how you've
configured certain settings:</p>

<ul><li>The assessment will be available only during the time frame you
specified in the "Delivery Dates" setting. If you leave the "Delivery
Dates" fields blank, your assessment will be available forever or
until you retract it. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting a published assessment</a>. <br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Assessment released to:" setting, if you selected
<strong><code>Anonymous</code></strong>, then anyone to whom you've given the
URL can take the assessment. If you selected your site
instead, then only site members will be able to take the assessment,
either via the URL or from within the site. For more information, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arbn">Taking an assessment</a>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>If you listed specific IP addresses in the "High
Security" setting, only people connecting from those computers will be
able to access your assessment.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you created a secondary username and password in the "High
Security" setting, people will need to authenticate with
that username and password to gain access.
</li></ul>
