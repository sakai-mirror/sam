<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Core Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the "Delivery Dates" and
"Gradebook Options" settings.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Core Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>You cannot delete a published assessment. You may, however, change
the "Retract Date" on an assessment so students cannot access it. To do
this, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting a published assessment</a>.</p>
