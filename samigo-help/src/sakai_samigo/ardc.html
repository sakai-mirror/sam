<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a

<p>The act of making an assessment available to its users is referred
to as publishing. Users will not be able to access your assessment
until it is published. You should make all modifications and
corrections to an assessment before publishing it. If you find an
error or wish to otherwise modify a published assessment, see the
following documents:</p>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arbq">Modifications to published assessments</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arab">Modifying an existing assessment</a>
</li></ul>

<p>To publish an assessment you've created, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  <br /><br />

</li><li>On the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", click the
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> button that corresponds to the assessment you wish
to publish.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Settings page, make sure all settings are configured
as you want them, and then click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Publish Assessment Confirmation page, you'll see the
settings you configured for the assessment, plus a URL you
can use to distribute the assessment. Click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong> again to
confirm, or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.
</li></ol>

<p>On the Assessments page, your newly published assessment will
appear under "Published Assessments"; a copy also remains under
"Core Assessments" in case future modifications are necessary.</p>
