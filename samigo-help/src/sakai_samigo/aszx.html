<h2>Viewing participant scores and answers to
individual questions</h2>







<p>To view student scores and answers to individual questions in
Tests &amp;
Quizzes:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a>, click <strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Assessments page, under "Published Assessments", find the
pertinent assessment, and under its title, click <strong><code>Scores</code></strong>. By
default, the Total Scores screen will open, displaying a table with
the following information for each participant:<br /><br />

<ul><li>Name
</li><li>User ID 
</li><li>Role
</li><li>Submit Date (the date the participant submitted the assessment)
</li><li>Status
</li><li>Total Score
</li><li>Adj (a field for you to enter an adjustment that will be added to
the Total Score; click <strong><code>Update</code></strong> to save your changes)
</li><li>Final (the participant's final score, calculated by adding the Total
Score and Adj values)
</li><li>Comment (a text box in which you can type comments that will
appear when participants view their submitted tests; click
<strong><code>Update</code></strong> to save your changes)
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, the information on the Total
Scores screen is sorted alphabetically by participant name. To sort
the information using another column, click the name of the column
(e.g., click <strong><code>Role</code></strong> to sort the information by participant
role). If you created sections
using the Section Info tool, you can use the drop-down list near the
top of the screen to choose to view information for a particular
section only. If you allowed multiple submissions, you can
use the drop-down list near the top of the screen to view only the
submission with the highest score.</p>
</li><li>To see the questions on the test, and your participants' answers
to each, near the top of the screen, click
<strong><code>Questions</code></strong>. Navigate through questions by clicking the
question links near the top of the screen.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This can allow you to quickly compare how
all students answered a specific question, but the only way to view
written responses is on a per-student basis.</p>
</li><li>To see information about the total number of submissions, the
total score possible, and statistical information (such as the mean,
median, mode, and range of the scores), near the top of the screen,
click <strong><code>Statistics</code></strong>.

<p>Beneath the cumulative information, each question is listed with a
histogram showing the number of students who selected a particular
response.</p>
