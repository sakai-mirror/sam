<h2>Retracting or removing a
    published assessment</h2>






<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you
must be assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To
determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Once an assessment is published, you can retract it from
student access or remove it.</p>

<h3>Retracting a published assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments", under the assessment's title, click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Settings page, click <strong><code>Delivery Dates</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can either retract your assessment immediately or specify a
date and time.

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To retract the assessment immediately, click <strong><code>Retract
Now</code></strong>. This will take you to the Immediate Assessment Retract
Confirmation page, where you can click <strong><code>Retract</code></strong> to continue or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to the Settings page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To retract the assessment at a specified date and time, click the
calendar icon to the right of the "Retract Date" text box.  Select a
date and time, and then, at the bottom of the screen, click <strong><code>Save
Settings</code></strong>.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p>When you retract an assessment, it remains under "Published
Assessments", but moves from the "Active (testing in progress)"
section to the "Inactive (no student access)" section.</p>

<p>To return a retracted assessment to active status, follow the above
steps, but delete the date and time from the "Retract Date"
text box. The assessment will have the same URL as it did before you
retracted it.</p>

<h3>Removing a published assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments", click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> under the
assessment you wish to remove.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> again to confirm.
 </li></ol>
