document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a

<p>Once an assessment is published it cannot be deleted, it can only
be retracted from student access. To retract a published assessment,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments", under the assessment's title, click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>To reveal this setting's options, on the Settings page, click
<strong><code>Delivery Dates</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>Check the box beside <strong><code>Retract Date</code></strong>, and then click the
calendar icon to the right of the text box. Choose a date in the past
to immediately retract the assessment, or choose a date and time at
which you want the assessment to be retracted. 
<br /><br /></li><li>At the bottom of the screen, click <strong><code>Save Settings</code></strong>. </li></ol>

<p>When you retract an assessment, it remains under "Published
Assessments", but moves from the "Active (testing in progress)"
section to the "Inactive (no student access)" section.</p>

<p>To return a retracted assessment to active status, follow the above
steps, but uncheck the box beside <strong><code>Retract Date</code></strong>. The
assessment will have the same URL as it did before you retracted
it.</p>
