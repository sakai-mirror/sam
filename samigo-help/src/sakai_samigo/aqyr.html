<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Creating questions is only one of the steps involved in creating an
assessment. Consider also reading the following documents:
</p><ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=ardm">Creating a new assessment</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>
</li></ul>

<p>You can choose from several types of questions when building an
assessment. Before you begin adding questions, consider reviewing the
different types available, which are outlined in the document <a href="content.hlp?docId=argy">Types of questions available for assessments</a>.</p>




<p>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or project site,
click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>. To create questions for an assessment, you
will use the authoring tool on the Assessments page. To create a new
assessment, under the "New Assessment" heading, type a name for your
assessment in the "Title:" field, and then click <strong><code>Create</code></strong>. You
may base the assessment on a saved template by choosing the template
from the "Choose Existing Template" drop-down list. You also can
import an assessment by using the Import feature. For more
information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting an assessment</a>.</p>

<p>To begin adding questions to a new assessment, choose the type of
question you want to add from the "Add Question:" drop-down
menu. Below, you'll find instructions for each question type:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#multa">Multiple Choice</a></li><li><a href="#surveya">Survey</a></li><li><a href="#essaya">Short Answer/Essay</a></li><li><a href="#fiba">Fill in the Blank</a></li><li><a href="#mata">Matching</a></li><li><a href="#truea">True/False</a></li><li><a href="#filea">File Upload</a></li><li><a href="#uploada">Copy from Question Pool</a></li></ul>

<a name="multa"> </a><h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

<p>To create a Multiple Choice question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:" drop-down list,
select <strong><code>Multiple Choice</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing screen.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Roses are {red} and violets are {blue}, but not always.</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "red" and "blue".</p>

</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer:" section, click the radio buttons to choose
between <strong><code>Single correct answer</code></strong> (the default) and <strong><code>Multiple
Correct Answers</code></strong>. As you change the selection, the screen will
refresh to allow or hide the requisite fields.  <br /><br />
</li><li>In the case of a single correct answer, you'll see four sets of
text boxes for possible answers and optional feedback. To indicate
which answer is the correct one, click the radio button next to it. In
the case of multiple correct answers, check the boxes beside the
correct responses.

<p>If you want to present fewer possible answers, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> beneath the text boxes you want to remove. If you want
to present more possibilities, use the drop-down list next to "Insert
additional answers:" to select the number of possibilities you want to
add.</p>
</li><li>If you want the possible answers to appear in a random order, next
to "Randomize Answers:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. To have them appear in
the order you see in the question editing screen (the default), click
<strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to require users to provide a rationale for choosing
an answer, next to "Required Rationale:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. If you
don't require a rationale (the default), click <strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down list, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as
the default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired pool
name.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:", you can provide
question-level feedback for correct and/or incorrect answers. 
<br /><br /></li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a name="surveya"> </a><h4>Survey</h4>

<p>The process for creating a Survey question is
similar to that used to create a Multiple Choice question, except for
the following differences:</p>
<ul><li>The "Answer Point Value:" field is default <code>0</code>
(zero). <br /><br />
</li><li>For the text of possible answers, you must choose from a
predefined set of scales commonly used for survey reporting. To select
the scale you want to use, click its corresponding radio button. The
choices are as follows:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Yes, No</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Undecided, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Below Average -&gt; Above Average</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Strongly Disagree -&gt; Strongly Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Unacceptable -&gt; Excellent</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 5</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 10</code></strong></li></ul><br />
</li><li>You do not have the option to randomize answers or require a
rationale.
</li></ul>
<a href="#topa">Back to top</a>
<a name="essaya"> </a><h4>Short Answer/Essay</h4>

<p>
To create a Short Answer/Essay question, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down list, select <strong><code>Short Answer/Essay</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.

<br /><br />
</li><li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down list, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as the
default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired
pool name.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer:" section, you can opt to provide a model short
answer or question-level feedback by typing it in the provided
fields.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a href="#topa">Back to top</a>
<a name="fiba"> </a><h4>Fill in the Blank</h4>

<p>To create a Fill in the Blank question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down list, select <strong><code>Fill in the Blank</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Roses are {red} and violets are {blue}, but not always.</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "red" and "blue".</p>


</li><li>In the "Question Text:" field, enter the text for the
question. Place curly braces (<code> { } </code>)
around words requiring a blank, for example:

<span class="example">  In Unix, to find the current directory path, type {pwd} at the prompt.</span>

<p>Other options for building a Fill in the Blank question include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Wildcards:</strong> Use an asterisk
(<code> * </code>) to represent one or more characters in a
response. For example:

<span class="example">An adverb, like {*ly}, modifies a verb.</span>
</li><li><strong>Either|Or:</strong> If two or more specific answers could
belong in a blank, you can use a pipe (<code> | </code>) to
separate them. For example:

<span class="example">  {red|yellow|blue} is the primary color I like best.</span>
</li><li><strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> Click to place a checkmark in
the "Case sensitive" checkbox if case matters in the response. For
example:

<span class="example">  The capital of California is {Sacramento}.</span>
</li><li><strong>Mutual exclusivity:</strong> Click to place a checkmark in
the "Mutually exclusive" checkbox if your question has two or more
blanks with identical answer choices, but the student must answer each
one differently. For example:

<span class="example">  When you toss a coin, it lands on {heads|tails} or {heads|tails}.</span>

<p>If the answers are mutually exclusive, the student must type
"heads" in one blank and "tails" in the other to answer the question
correctly. If the answers were not mutually exclusive, then typing
"heads" in both blanks would be considered correct.</p>

<p>You can use the mutually exclusive option only when it applies to
all the blanks in a question. For example, take the following
question:</p>

<span class="example">  We mixed {red|blue} and {red|blue} dye together to make {purple}.</span>

<p>If you select the mutually exclusive option for the above question,
it will automatically uncheck itself when you save your question.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>If your assessment has more than one part (i.e., section), use the
"Assign to Part:" drop-down list to assign the question to a specific
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>To save the question in a question pool for later use, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired pool
name. To do this, you must have created at least one question
pool. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>The "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:" fields allow you to set
optional messages for students. Use the assessment's feedback settings
to determine if and when students see these messages. For more
information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
Questions screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
