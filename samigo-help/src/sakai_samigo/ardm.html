<h2>Creating a new assessment</h2>









<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the feedback option in
Tests
&amp; Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test. 
</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click
<strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>.  From the Assessments page, you can
create a new assessment from scratch or by using a template. (For more
information about using templates, see the document <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding/creating, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.) You also can import an assessment by using the
Import feature. For more information, see the document <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting an assessment</a>.
</p>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>There are four basic steps to creating a new assessment:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#name">Name your assessment</a></li><li><a href="#settings">Configure the settings</a></li><li><a href="#sections">Create parts</a></li><li><a href="#questions">Create questions</a></li></ul>

<a name="name"> </a><h4>Name your assessment</h4>

<p>In the New Assessment area, under "Create a new assessment", type a
title for your assessment in the "Title" field, and then click
<strong><code>Create</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing screen.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="settings"> </a><h4>Configure the settings</h4>

<p>The <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> link, available from the Assessments page or
from the editing screen, allows you to specify various parameters for
the assessment (e.g., delivery dates and security settings). For more
information on the possible settings for an assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="sections"> </a><h4>Create parts</h4>

<p>When you create a new assessment, a part (i.e., section) called
"Default" is created automatically. If you leave it named "Default",
its title will not appear on your assessment (i.e., your assessment
won't display a part's title if its title is "Default"; to change the
"Default" part's name, click <strong><code>Modify</code></strong>). You can begin adding
questions immediately to "Default", or you can add your own parts.</p>

<p>To add a part to your assessment, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>On the editing screen, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the part editing screen, next to "Title", type a name for this
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Information", you may use the WYSIWYG editor to enter a
brief description or instructions.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Type", use the radio buttons to indicate that you'll be
authoring questions one-by-one, or use a random draw from one of your
question pools. For the latter option, use the accompanying text box
to indicate the number of questions, and use the drop-down list to
choose the name of the pool from which to draw them.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Question ordering", use the radio buttons to either dictate
the order of questions, or allow a random ordering within the
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Metadata", you may use the text boxes to record any
objectives, keywords, or rubrics.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To save your changes, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>. To cancel them, click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.

</li></ol>

<p>New parts will be listed in the order you create them. To switch
the order of two parts, before a part's name, change the number in the
drop-down list (i.e., next to "Part"). For example, if you have three
parts, and you want the third part to appear first, use the drop-down
list to change the <strong><code>3</code></strong> to <strong><code>1</code></strong>. The third and first parts
will switch places.</p>

<p>To modify the name, and any of the information and settings
associated with a part, next to that part's name, click
<strong><code>Modify</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Your assessment must always contain at least one part, but you can
remove any of the parts you create. You can also remove the "Default"
part, as long as you've already created another part to replace
it.</p>

<p>To remove a part, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>Next to the part's name, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the subsequent confirmation screen, use the radio buttons to
choose between the following:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Remove part and all questions</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Remove part only
and move question(s) to</code></strong> (use the accompanying drop-down list to
choose another part)
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part listed on the editing screen
will not have the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option. To remove the first part,
you must switch its order with another part (if you don't have another
part, you'll have to create one), and then click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.</p>


<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="questions"> </a><h4>Create questions</h4>


<p>You can either create a new question to add to the assessment, or
you can add a question from a Question Pool.  To add your first
question, first create an assessment, then from the drop-down menu
next to "Add Question:", choose the type of question to add. For more
information on question types, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>. Once you've selected the type of question, the
question editing screen will open.</p>

<p>To add a question from a Question pool, click the drop-down menu
next to Add Question and select "Copy from Question Pool."</p>

<p>On the question editing screen, the available options will depend upon
the type of question you are adding. If you'd like to change the type
of question, you can choose another option from the "Change Question
Type" drop-down menu. Options common to most question types include:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong>Answer Point Value:</strong> Specify the point value for
each response in a question, or specify 0 (zero) for a survey or
ungraded question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Roses are {red} and violets are {blue}, but not always.</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "red" and "blue".</p>

</li><li><strong>Question Text:</strong> State the actual question to be
asked.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Answer:</strong> Indicate the correct answer or
answers. You have the option to include feedback for specific
responses (item-level feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assign to Part:</strong> If you have created your
own parts, you may assign a question to any of those parts;
otherwise, it will be assigned to the default part.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assign to Question Pool:</strong> Add this question to a
question pool that you've created. For information about question
pools, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Feedback (optional):</strong> Provide feedback for a
correct or incorrect response to the question (question-level
feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Save:</strong> Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to add the question to
your assessment or to save any changes to the question.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort the
question or changes and return to the editing screen.
</li></ul>

<p>After you insert a question into your new assessment, a drop-down
list, <strong><code>Insert New Question</code></strong>, will appear in the assessment
editing screen at the end of each part. Use this button to add a
question directly to a specific part. Near the top, within the
assessment's title bar, clicking <strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong> allows
you to preview the assessment as it presently stands. After you've
saved questions within your assessment, you can use the corresponding
<strong><code>Modify</code></strong> and <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> buttons to alter or delete
questions.</p>
