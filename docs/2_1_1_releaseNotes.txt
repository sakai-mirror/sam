2.1.1 Release Notes
as of 2/3/06 (updates can be found at http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/SAM/2.1.1)


1. Functional Enhancements

  * Question Feedback Authoring: Improved usability by adding the ability to author question-level feedback (fewer text boxes), selection-level feedback (more text boxes) or both. 
  * Timed Assessments: Moved the tracking of remaining time to the server from the client. This makes the time remaining less susceptable to cheating or browser/Javascript problems.
