2.1 Release Notes
=================================================================

1. Known Issues
---------------

  SAK-1419 Adding random draw part in authoring removes questions in other parts. The work around, detailed in SAK-2779, is to only use one random draw part in any given assessment. 



2. Functional Enhancements
--------------------------

  2.1. Added "section-awareness", that is the ability to filter assessments by sections (e.g. discussion, labs, etc.) in the grading interface. Based on memberships assigned in the new Section Info tool, now teaching assistants can only see students' assessments for the sections for which they are responsible. Alternatively, the instructor can choose to look at assessments one section at a time. SAK-1929 

  2.2. Improved workflows based on 2.0.1 usability testing: 

   2.2.1. Assessment Authoring 

    A. Feedback input boxes are now under question text input boxes to eliminate horizontal scrolling SAK-2305 
    B. Other small enhancements, see SAK-369, SAK-2109, SAK-2238, SAK-2303, SAK-2306, SAK-2325 

   2.2.2. Assessment Taking 

    A. Student immediately sees questions of first part on table of contents expanded rather than collapsed and "Submit for Grading" button is now on last question page for random-access assessments (same as linear assessments) SAK-2363 

    B. Other small enhancements, see SAK-1911, SAK-2244, SAK-2364 



3. Technical Enhancements
-------------------------

  3.1. Code refactored to expose an API for the tool. (src/org/sakaiproject/tool/assessment/shared/api) Now the Sakai framework or other tools can call this API rather than making direct method calls. This level of abstraction allows for: 

    3.1.1. Looser coupling with Sakai (or another CMSs). 

    3.1.2. A clean stand-alone build of the tool.

    3.1.3. More information on these changes can be found here: https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/trunk/sakai/sam/docs/
