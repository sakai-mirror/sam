Service Design.

   1. Starting with version 2.1, the internal services in the service package
   are being replaced with the pure-interface api definitions in the api package
   jar.  Although you can call a rich set of service APIs internally within
   Samigo, and we may continue to do so for the forseeable future, external
   webapps wishing to use Samigo services SHOULD use the services defined by
   these APIs, and should NOT directly call the implementation specific domain
   obejects and services internal to the component jar.

   2. External users of Samigo services should include a dependency on the api
   jar and build their webapp with the component jar in the lib.  The component
   jar has all the configuration objects needed. Assuming that your webapp is
   running in a Sakai environment, you should use the spring injections in the
   sakai-samigo version of Samigo's webapp.
