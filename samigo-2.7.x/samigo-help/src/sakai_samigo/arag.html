<h2>Assessment settings</h2>









<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To reach the Settings page for an assessment, from the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of
the appropriate worksite, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  On the Assessments page, click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> beneath the title of the assessment.  Click the
black arrow for a type of setting to see the options.
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Altering the settings for one assessment
does not impact the settings of other assessments you
created. Altering the options in the settings for an assessment does
not impact any other options.</p>


<p>The settings available depend on whether or not your assessment is
published; see <a href="#pub">Settings for published assessments</a> below.  They also depend on what assessment type you have created
for use with an assessment. The default assessment type does not
include all possible settings.</p>

<p>If you wish to include more settings than you see available for an
unpublished assessment, you will need to create and edit a new
assessment type. To do this, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding/creating, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.</p>


<h3>Assessment Settings</h3>


<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the feedback option in
Tests
&amp; Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide

Palette</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Grey Scale Palette</code></strong>), and then click on the
color you want to use for your assessment's background color. The

file to be used as the background image.
</li></ul>

<br />

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the following settings:</p>

<ul><li>Under "Assessment Introduction": Title, Creator, Author(s), Description/Intro, and Attachments</li><li>Under "Delivery Dates": Available Date, Due Date, and Retract Date</li><li>Under "Assessment Organization": Navigation and Numbering</li><li>Under "Submissions": Number of Submissions Allowed and Late Handling</li><li>Under "Feedback": Feedback Authoring, Feedback Delivery, and Feedback Components Students Can See</li><li>Under "Grading": Students' Identities and Gradebook Options</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>
