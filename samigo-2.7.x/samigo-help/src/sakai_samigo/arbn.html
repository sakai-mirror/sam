<h2>Taking an assessment</h2>










<p>To take an assessment, you can use the URL supplied by your
instructor, or, from within Tests &amp;
Quizzes, click its name in the list of available
assessments.</p>

<p>If you have the ability to create assessments in a site, you must
use the URL to take an assessment. Otherwise, in Tests &amp; Quizzes, you'll
only be able to view the Assessments page, which contains your core
and published assessments.</p>

<p>If you don't have the ability to create assessments in a site, and
don't want to use the URL:</p>

<ol><li>From the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Take an assessment", you will see a list of available
assessments. Click an assessment's title to see information about the
assessment, such as the date due, whether or not there is a time
limit, and whether or not the assessment will automatically be
submitted if the time limit expires.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Begin Assessment</code></strong> to take the assessment, or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.
</li></ol>

<p>Depending on how the assessment has been set up, you may have the
option during the assessment to save your work and continue, to submit
it, and to return to previous sections or questions. When you click
<strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>, you will receive a confirmation number
that you should keep.</p>
